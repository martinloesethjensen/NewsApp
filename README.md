# NewsApp
## News application coding challenge
The application is a very simple app made in Kotlin, that fetches news from a news api and puts the results in a list.
Every article shown on the list is a cardview that also shows the article title and description. 
When an article is tapped an in-app web-view is shown.
Below is the criteria for completion.
___

Create a small news application that makes use of the https://newsapi.org/ API for retrieving news data. The application should be able to show a scrollable list of news stories with a corresponding image. Further, it should be possible to tap a news story and have it open in an in-app webview. 

Moreover, the project should make use of the following concepts / libraries:

- The MVVM architecture
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for networking
- RecyclerView for the list of news stories
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for image handling

For bonus points, the project can make use of the following (this isnâ€™t required, but it refers to technologies we use at Adapt):

- Kotlin instead of Java
- [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor)
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
